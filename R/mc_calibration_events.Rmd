# Introduction

It is time to calibrate the mode choice constants. To do this, we will calibrate modal shares based on trips of each tour purpose for differing auto deficiency classes. The target shares will be those that were calculated from ActivitySim. These targets are similarly shown in BEAM's 0th iteration of a run that was completed with mode selection turned off.

To do this calibration, we will compare the 0.events.csv file of a run done with mode innovation turned off, with the ith.events.csv file of a run done with mode innovation turned on (where ith is the last iteration.) We will use the formula below to the calibration:

$NewASC = OldASC + ln(Trips_{BEAM}/Trips_{ASIM})$

where each formula is dependent on purpose, mode, and auto deficiency.

# Data Manipulation
From what I understand, Vedant is using the ith.plans.xml.gz file or the ith.experienced_plans.xml.gz. I think the plans.xml file includes all possible plans (even those that are not selected by the MNL model). The experienced_plans, however, only shows the selected plans. Therefore, the analysis should be done with the experienced_plans.

Instead though, I want to be able to use the events file. So, we are going to check to see if the events file has the same trip information. If not, we may need to use the experienced_plans file some way.

So, lets read in the o.events and see what we get.
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
asim <- read_csv("events/slc-light-2.5k-hovtest-all__2022-01-01_12-26-56_khe/ITERS/it.0/0.events.csv", col_types = cols(.default = "c")) %>%
  filter(type == "ModeChoice") %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  select(person, tourIndex, tourPurpose, mode,currentTourMode, income, vehicleOwnership, availableAlternatives, personalVehicleAvailable, length, time, type) %>%
  arrange(person)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
asimSum <- asim %>% group_by(mode,vehicleOwnership,tourPurpose) %>% summarize(trips = n())

asimSumm <- asim %>% summarize(sum = n())
```

The total number of trips for the 0th iteration is 8003 according to the experienced_plans file, and according to the mode choice events, we get 8019. I wonder why they are not the same... The events has 2 extra car, 12 extra walk, and 2 extra walk_transit. That is where the extra 16 comes from.

Now we read in the 15th iteration.
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
beam <- read_csv("events/slc-light-2.5k-hovtest-all__2022-01-01_12-26-56_khe/ITERS/it.15/15.events.csv", col_types = cols(.default = "c")) %>%
  filter(type == "ModeChoice") %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  select(person, tourIndex, tourPurpose, mode,currentTourMode, income, vehicleOwnership, availableAlternatives, personalVehicleAvailable, length, time, type) %>%
  arrange(person)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
beamSum <- beam %>% group_by(mode,vehicleOwnership,tourPurpose) %>% summarize(trips = n())

beamSumm <- beam %>% summarize(sum = n())
```

The total number of trips for the 15th iteration is 7988 according to the experienced_plans file, and according to the mode choice events, we get 8002. I wonder why they are not the same... The events has 1 extra car, 12 extra walk, and 1 extra walk_transit. That is where the extra 14 comes from.

## figureing out why there are extra mc events
First, we figure out what agent has an extra car, walk_transit, and walk modes from iteration 15 events file.Then we compare his experienced plan with the mode choice event. We also analyze the component of the events.csv file to see if we figure out why these extra modes exist

### Extra car
The extra car is this guy: *812340*
  Output_experienced_plans: Ride_hail, car, car, car, car, car
  15: Experienced_plans:    Ride_hail, car, car, car, car, car
  15: Mode Choice Events:   Ride_hail, *car*, car, car, car, car, car
  15.events.csv
    Type:      legMode:
    departure  Ridehail
    departure  car
    departure  car
    departure  car
    departure  car
    departure  car
    arrival    car
    arrival    car
    arrival    car
    arrival    car
    arrival    car
    arrival    car
  ResourceUnavailable RIDE_HAIL

### Extra Walk_Transit

The extra walk_transit is this guy: *2480060**
  Output_experienced_plans: Drive_transit, walk, hov2, hov2
  15: Experienced_plans:    Drive_transit, walk, hov2, hov2
  15: Mode Choice Events:   Drive_transit, *walk_transit*, walk, hov2, hov2
  15.events.csv
    Type:      legMode:
    departure  drive_transit
    departure  walk
    departure  hov2
    departure  hov2
    arrival    walk_transit
    arrival    walk
    arrival    hov2
    arrival    hov2
  Reason for Replanning: MissedTransitPickup DRIVE_TRANSIT 

### Replanning doesn't register in experienced_plans, but does in mode choice event

Looking closer at the events file itself, it looks like the person departed with the mode drive_transit, but then arrived with the mode walk_transit. This is because there was an error with the drive_transit mode, causing *REPLANNING* to occur. It replanned, and selected walk_transit as the mode. A mode choice event was documented for both drive_transit and walk_transit though! That's where the extra mode comes from. 

This similarly occured with the extra car mode, but instead of a replanning error, there was a *ResourceUnavailable* error, where the ride_hail wasn't available so it defaulted to car.

Also, it looks like the experienced_plans only matches with the *departed* modes, not the arrivals! Or, the experienced_plans does not get updated for within day replanning or resourceunavailable errors! Maybe I can turn that off/on somewhere? AKA, maybe I can fix the experienced plans to use the UPDATED mode.

## Extra 12 walks

Lets try and see where the extra walks are coming from!
  
```{r}
beamwalk <- beam %>% filter(mode =="walk")
```

I found one guy that has an extra walk mode in the mode choice events compared to the 15.experienced_plans.xml file. Agent *1507898*. Interestingly enough, in the experienced_plans his last activity is othmaint and not Home! So I think the mode choice event registers the agent going home but the experienced plan does not. 

Other agents that don't end at home:
  - 1748707
  - 1780993
  - 1920415
  - 1920974
  - 2047655
  - 2378291
  - 718540
  - 831611
  - 881739
  - 891443

I didn't check all of them, but I think it is safe to say more walk trips exist in the mode choice events than in the output_events because some agents don't make their last trip before the day ends! I beleive this is because the walk trips are too long and they don't have sufficient time to make it back!

  
## Important notes

Above we see that the outpuT_experienced_plans matches the last iteration experienced plans. 

Another thing to help us learn some stuff is to compare the plans file with the experienced plans file. it looks like the plans file are the values fed into an iteration and the experienced plans come out of an iteration. In other words, the plans file corresponds to the experienced plans from one iteration before.  
  
15.plans.xml.gz  
  plans_no_1_24.564  : Drive_transit, walk, hov3, hov3
  plans_no_2_24.714  : drive_transit, walk, hov3_teleportation, hov3_teleportation
  plans_no_3_27.47   : drive_transit, walk, car, hov3 *--highest score*
  plans_yes_1_24.564 : drive_transit, walk, hov3, hov3
15.plans.csv.gz
  plans_no_1_24.564  : Drive_transit, walk, hov3, hov3
  plans_no_2_24.714  : drive_transit, walk, hov3_teleportation, hov3_teleportation
  plans_no_3_27.47   : drive_transit, walk, car, hov3
  plans_yes_1_27.528 : drive_transit, walk, hov3, hov3 *--highest score*
14.experienced_plans.xml.gz
  drive_transit, walk, car, hov3 *--chosen somehow?*
14.events.csv
  Type:      legMode:
  departure  drive_transit
  departure  walk
  departure  car
  departure  hov3
  arrival    walk_transit
  arrival    walk
  arrival    hov2
  arrival    hov2
  
10.plans.xml.gz
  plans_no_1_24.564  : Drive_transit, walk, hov3, hov3
  plans_no_2_30.376  : drive_transit, walk, car, car
  plans_yes_2_30.376 : drive_transit, walk, car, car
9.experienced_plans.xml.gz
  drive_transit, walk, car, car
  
  
Comparing these though something interesting exists. Just because a plan is "yes" selected in the plans file, doesn't mean it is the one used in the experienced plans! This is super weird. For example, plan 1 was "yes" selected in the 15.plans file, but in the end, plan 3 was chosen. I suspect it has to do with it being the highest score.

I also noticed that the plans.csv and plans.xml aren't compeltely the same. In one of them the selected plan did have the highest score, whereas in the xml it did not! This causes even more confusion with how these plans files work.


## Stuff I need to understand
- Why are there extra modes in the mode choice events when compared to the experienced_plans file? 
*Answer:* 
- RideHail and DriveTransit can cause replanning, or a default mode to be chosen instead, thus throwing a new mode choice event that isn't updated with the experienced_plans.
- Some agents pick walk as their last trip of the day, but because they are too far away from home, they don't make it by the time the day ends. Thus, this last trip isn't registered in the experienced_plans. 


- Why is it that sometimes the "selected" plan in the plans file does not match that of the experienced_plans from the previous iteration? 
  - does it just take the largest score instead?
  - If it takes the largest score, whats the point of marking a plan as "yes" for 
    selected?
  - Also, why does the largest score differ between the plans.xml and the plans.csv   
    files?

Ideas on how to understand it
- search in beam code and understand how mode choice events, plan, and experienced plans are created
- continue to compare output files and continue to clarify the picture of whats happening
  - check plans.csv file
  - dive into events file
  
# Arrival Events
What if I instead calibrate based on arrival events? I think every arrival represents a trip that was completed. This will make sure not to count the extra walk modes as trips that actually don't occur because the person didn't make it home. It will also account for replanning modes and unavailable ride hail vehicles, because the mode that is registered is the arrival mode. I would just have to add some attributes to the arrival events, which shouldn't be too hard!

```{r}
beamarrival <- beam %>% filter(type == "arrival") %>% 
  group_by(legMode) %>%
  summarize(modeNum = n())
```

  
  

# Extra Stuff
```{r}
events2.0 <- read_csv("events/0.events.csv", col_types = cols(.default = "c")) %>%
  filter(type == "ModeChoice") %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  select(person, tourIndex, tourPurpose, mode,currentTourMode, income, vehicleOwnership, availableAlternatives, personalVehicleAvailable, length, time, type) %>%
  arrange(person)

modalsplits <- events2.0 %>%
  group_by(mode) %>% 
  summarise(cnt = n()) %>%
  mutate(pct = cnt / sum(cnt) * 100,iter = 1)

eventsTrip1 <- events2.0 %>% filter(tourIndex == 1)
eventstest <- events2.0  %>% filter(mode %in% c("hov2","hov3","hov2_teleportation","hov3_teleportation","car")) %>%
  filter(mode != currentTourMode)

hovsplits <- events2.0 %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  filter(mode %in% c("hov2","hov3","hov2_teleportation","hov3_teleportation")) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n()) %>%
  mutate(pct = cnt / sum(cnt) * 100,iter = 1)

ggplot(hovsplits) + 
  aes(x = iter,y = pct, fill = mode) + 
  ggtitle("Modal Split by Tour Purpose") +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") + theme_bw()
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
